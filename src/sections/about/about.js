                    For the past <b className="font-bold">4+</b> years
                    I've experienced <b className="text-secondary">Front-End</b> and <b className="text-secondary">Back-End</b> development.
                    I'm also a self-taught programmer, self-motivated and passionate for software development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have deployed multiple mobile applications on{" "}
                    <b>Appstore</b> and <b>Playstore</b> from scratch with different challenges due to strict requirements/compliance from those platforms.

                    Music helps me concentrate, focus, blocks out distractions, and even makes tedious task more enjoyable.

                    Sometimes I go outside and take a 5-10 minute walk when I'm feeling stuck to help me return to my tasks with more refreshed and focused mind.
