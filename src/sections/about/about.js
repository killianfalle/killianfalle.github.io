                    I have gained experience in both <b>front-end</b> and <b>back-end</b> development.

                    I have successfully deployed multiple mobile applications on the App Store and Play Store from scratch, 
                    overcoming strict requirements and compliance challenges. In addition, 
                    I have created responsive websites that are fast, smooth, and easy to use, always ensuring that 
                    I follow coding standards and best practices.

                    Music helps me concentrate and focus, blocking out distractions and making tedious tasks more enjoyable. 
                    When I'm feeling stuck, I sometimes take a 5-10 minute walk outside to return to my tasks with a refreshed and focused mind.
